### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dimitri Racordon.
I love coding, talking about programming languages and playing Stracraft 2.

I am a post-doc researcher at University of Geneva, focusing my work on type-based approaches for memory safety.
My main research interests include type systems (obviously), language design, compiler construction and virtual machine implementations.
I am currently involved in two projects; one consists in developing a low-level IR to analyze memory safety properties, the other is to formalize (parts of) the Swift programming language.
