### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dimitri Racordon.
I love coding stuff, talking about programming languages and playing Stracraft 2.

I am a post-doc researcher at Northeastern University, in the US, focusing my work on type-based approaches for memory safety.
My main research interests include type systems (obviously), language design, compiler construction and virtual machine implementations.
I am currently directing most of my efforts in a project called [Val](www.val-lang.dev) with the objective to explore the use of mutable value semantics to create a safe-by-default and fast-by-definition programming language for generic high-level systems programming.
